Bugfix: Fix wrong formatted XML in public-files dav endpoint

Previously, trying to perform a PROPFIND over the public-files endpoint
could cause an exception to be thrown, which would generate a wrong formatted
XML response. Now, the XML response is properly formatted and can be parsed
without problems.
