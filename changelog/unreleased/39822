Bugfix: Fix issue restoring versions from the trashbin after sharing

Previously, having encryption enabled, if a user shared a folder with
another user, and that new user removed a file inside that shared folder,
that file ended up in the new user's trashbin along with the file's versions.
Restoring that file from the trashbin caused the versions of that file
to get broken due to a bad signature. The file was restored correctly.
Now, the versions are also restored correctly from the trashbin too.
