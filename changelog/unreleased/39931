Bugfix: Remove fr_FR language variant

French translations were in both the "fr" and the "fr_FR" language codes.
"fr_FR" had very few translations and could cause missing translations when the
system did not automatically choose "fr". The "fr_FR" translations have been removed.
Translators should use "fr" when doing translations in Transifex.
