Enhancement: Allow files_external app to be disabled

Previously, the files_external app couldn't be disabled. The corresponding
section in the settings page had a checkbox to show or not the settings
for the files_external app.
Now, if the app is disabled, that section won't appear. The behavior will
be the same as any other disabled app.
